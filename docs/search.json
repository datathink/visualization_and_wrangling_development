    "text": "Overview\nI lifted this from http://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html\nThis describes a hands-on activity where the goal is to author an R Markdown document and render it to HTML.\nHere is the official R Markdown documentation: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com\n\n\nStep 0: Software installation and configuration\nWe assume the following\n\nYou’ve already installed R and RStudio.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Get ready to work\nLaunch RStudio, probably in the Project that corresponds to the repository where you are keeping all our coursework. Make sure the workspace is clean and you’ve launched a fresh R process. Make sure the working directory is sensible.\n\n\nStep 2: Practice with RStudio’s boilerplate R Markdown document\nI am modelling “walk before you run” here. It is best, especially for novices, to increase complexity in small increments. We will test our system’s ability to render the “hello world” of R Markdown documents before we muddy the waters with our own, probably buggy, documents.\nDo this: File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown …\n\nGive it an informative title. This will appear in the document but does not necessarily have anything to do with the file’s name. But the title and filename should be similar! The title is for human eyeballs, so it can contain spaces and punctuation. The filename is for humans and computers, so it should have similar words in it but no spaces and no punctuation.\nAccept the default Author or edit if you wish.\nAccept the default output format of HTML.\nClick OK.\n\nSave this document to a reasonable filename and location. The filename should end in .Rmd or .rmd. I highly recommend saving in the top-level of the directory that is also an RStudio project and that is also current working directory. Trust me on this.\nClick on “Knit HTML” or do File &gt; Knit Document. RStudio should display a preview of the resulting HTML. Also look at the file browser (which should be pointed at the directory where you saved the .Rmd file). You should see the R Markdown document, i.e. foo.Rmd AND the resulting HTML foo.html.\nCongratulations, you’ve just made your first reproducible report with R Markdown.\n\n\nStep 3: Take control of the output format\nDo you really want HTML? Do you only want HTML? If so, you can skip this step!\nThe magical process that turns your R Markdown to HTML is like so: foo.Rmd --&gt; foo.md --&gt; foo.html. Note the intermediate markdown, foo.md. By default RStudio discards this, but you might want to hold on to that markdown.\nWhy? GitHub, which we will learn about soon, gives very special treatment to markdown files. They are rendered in an almost HTML-like way. This is great because it preserves all the charms of plain text but gives you a pseudo-webpage for free when you visit the file in the browser. In contrast, HTML is rendered as plain text on GitHub and you’ll have to take special measures to see it the way you want.\nOutput format is one of the many things we can control in the YAML frontmatter – the text at the top of your file between leading and trailing lines of ---.\nYou can make some changes via the RStudio IDE: click on the “gear” in the top bar of the source editor, near the “Knit HTML” button. Select “Output options” and go to the Advanced tab and check “Keep markdown source file.” Your YAML should now look more like this:\n    ---  \n    title: \"Something fascinating\"  \n    author: \"Jenny Bryan\"  \n    date: \"2024-04-29\"\n    output:  \n      html_document:  \n        keep_md: true  \n    ---  \nYou should have gained the line keep_md: true. You can also simply edit the file yourself to achieve this.\nSave!\nRender via “Knit HTML” button.\nNow revisit the file browser. In addition to foo.Rmd, you should now see foo.md. If there are R chunks that make figures, the usage of markdown output formats will also cause those figure files to be left behind in a sensibly named sub-directory, foo_files.\n\n\nStep 4: Swap out the “guts” of the document\nSelect everything but the YAML frontmatter and … delete it!\nWrite a single English sentence.\nInsert an empty R chunk, via the “Chunk” menu in upper right of source editor or with corresponding keyboard shortcut.\n?```{r}\n?## insert your brilliant WORKING code here\n?```\nInsert 1 to 3 lines of functioning code that begin the task at hand. “Walk through” and run those lines using the “Run” button or the corresponding keyboard shortcut. You MUST make sure your code actually works!\nSatisfied? Save!\nNow render the whole document via “Knit HTML.” Voilà!\n\n\nStep 5: Develop your report\nIn this incremental manner, develop your report. Add code to this chunk. Refine it. Add new chunks. Go crazy! But keep running the code “manually” to make sure it works.\nIf it doesn’t work with you babysitting it, I can guarantee you it will fail, in a more spectacular and cryptic way, when run at arms-length via “Knit HTML” or rmarkdown::render().\nClean out your workspace and restart R and re-run everything periodically, if things get weird. There are lots of chunk menu items and keyboard shortcuts to accelerate this workflow. Render the whole document often to catch errors when they’re easy to pinpoint and fix. Save often and commit every time you reach a point that you’d like as a “fall back” position.\nYou’ll develop your own mojo soon, but this should give you your first successful R Markdown experience.\n\n\nStep 6: Publish your report\nIf you’ve been making HTML, you can put that up on the web somewhere, email to your collaborator, whatever.\nNo matter what, technically you can publish this report merely by pushing a rendered version to GitHub. However, certain practices make this effort at publishing more satisfying for your audience.\nThis is (sort of) another example of keeping things machine- and human-readable, which is bliss. By making foo.Rmd available, others can see and run your actual code. By sharing foo.md and/or foo.html, others can casually browse your end product and decide if they even want to bother.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nMake sure RStudio and the rmarkdown package (and its dependencies) are up-to-date. In case of catastrophic failure to render R Markdown, consider that your software may be too old. R Markdown has been developing rapidly (written 2015-09), so you need a very current version of RStudio and rmarkdown to enjoy all the goodies we describe in this course.\nGet rid of your .Rprofile, at least temporarily. I have found that a “mature” .Rprofile that has accumulated haphazardly over the years can cause trouble. Specifically, if you’ve got anything in there relating to knitr, markdown, rmarkdown and RStudio stuff, it may be preventing the installation or usage of the most recent goodies (see above). Comment the whole file out or rename it something else and relaunch or even re-install RStudio.\nInsert a chunk in your .Rmd document so that it renders even when there are errors. Some errors are easier to diagnose if you can execute specific R statements during rendering and leave more evidence behind for forensic examination. Put this chunk:\n?```{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}  \n?knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)  \n?```\nnear the top of your R Markdown document if you want to soldier on through errors, i.e. turn foo.Rmd into foo.md and/or foo.html no matter what. This is also helpful if you are writing a tutorial and want to demo code that throws an error. You might want to keep this as an RStudio snippet for easy insertion.\nTolerate errors in one specific chunk. If it’s undesirable to globally accept errors, you can still do this for a specific chunk like so:\n?```{r wing-and-a-prayer, error = TRUE}  \n?## your sketchy code goes here ;) \n?```\nCheck your working directory. It’s going to break your heart as you learn how often your mistakes are really mundane and basic. Ask me how I know. When things go wrong consider:\n\nWhat is the working directory?\nIs that file I want to read/write actually where I think it is?\n\nDrop these commands into R chunks to check the above:\n\ngetwd() will display working directory at run time. If you monkeyed around with working directory with, e.g., the mouse, maybe it’s set to one place for your interactive development and another when “Knit HTML” takes over?\nlist.files() will list the files in working directory. Is the file you want even there?\n\nDon’t try to change working directory within an R Markdown document. Just don’t. That is all.\nDon’t be in a hurry to create a complicated sub-directory structure. RStudio/knitr/rmarkdown (which bring you the “Knit HTML” button) are rather opinionated about the working directory being set to the .Rmd file’s location and about all files living together in one big happy directory. This can all be worked around. But not today."

Your boss has asked you to go through the transactions for each business and provide daily, weekly, and monthly gross revenue summaries and comparisons. Your boss would like a short write up with tables and visualizations that help with the decision of which company did the best over the three month period. You will also need to provide a short paragraph with your recommendation after building your analysis.\nIn our course we are only looking at understanding and visualizing recorded time series data.

If you would like to learn more about forecasting I would recommend Forecasting: Principles and Practice and for a quick introduction see here\n\nCourse Website\n\n\n\n\nThis reading will help you complete the tasks below.\n\no lubridate R package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead in the data from https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/sales.csv and format it for visualization and analysis\n\nThe data are for businesses in the mountain time zone make sure you read in times correctly\nThis is point of sale (pos) data, so you will need to use library(lubridate) to create the correct time aggregations\nCheck the data for any inaccuracies\n\nHelp your boss understand which business is the best investment through visualizations\n\nProvide an understanding and recommendation for hours of operation\nWe don’t have employee numbers, but sales traffic can help. Provide some visualizations on customer traffic\nProvide a final comparison of the six companies and a final recommendation\n\nCompile your .md and .html file into your git repository\nFind two other student’s compiled files in their repository and provide feedback using the issues feature in GitHub (If they already have three issues find a different student to critique)\nAddress 1-2 of the issues posted on your project and push the updates to GitHub"

    "text": "Git Installation\n\nGit Installation: Windows\nInstall Git for Windows, also known as msysgit or “Git Bash”, to get Git in addition to some other useful tools, such as the Bash shell. Yes, all those names are totally confusing, but you might encounter them elsewhere and I want you to be well-informed.\nThis method of installing Git for Windows leaves the Git executable in a conventional location, which will help you and other programs, e.g. RStudio, find it and use it. This also supports a transition to more expert use, because the “Git Bash” shell will be useful as you venture outside of R/RStudio.\n\nWhen asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, we believe it is good to accept the defaults.\nNote that RStudio for Windows prefers for Git to be installed below C:/Program Files and this appears to be the default. This implies, for example, that the Git executable on my Windows system is found at C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe. Unless you have specific reasons to otherwise, follow this convention.\n\nIf you follow these instructions and install RStudio version 1.1 or higher, you can use the shell (also called the terminal) directly from within RStudio. See this article for more information on how to use it and setup RStudio to use Git Bash, rather than the Command Prompt.\n\n\nGit Installation: Mac OS X\nMac OS X already includes the shell, so all you need to do is install Git.\n\nOption 1 (highly recommended)\nInstall the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git.\nGo to the shell and enter one of these commands to elicit an offer to install developer command line tools:\ngit --version\ngit config\nAccept the offer! Click on “Install”.\nHere’s another way to request this installation, more directly:\nxcode-select --install\nWe just happen to find this Git-based trigger apropos.\nNote also that, after upgrading macOS, you might need to re-do the above and/or re-agree to the Xcode license agreement. We have seen this cause the RStudio Git pane to disappear on a system where it was previously working. Use commands like those above to tickle Xcode into prompting you for what it needs, then restart RStudio.\n\n\nOption 2 (recommended)\nInstall Git from here: http://git-scm.com/downloads.\n\nThis arguably sets you up the best for the future. It will certainly get you the latest version of Git of all approaches described here.\nThe GitHub home for the macOS installer is here: https://github.com/timcharper/git_osx_installer.\n\nAt that link, you can find more info if something goes wrong or you are working on an old version of macOS.\n\n\n\n\n\nGit Installation: Linux\nIf Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via your distro’s package manager.\nDebian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt-get install git\nFedora/Redhat Linux\nsudo yum install git"

Install it by running the command\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nfrom the console in RStudio. Then run the following commands:\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"hathawayj\", user.email = \"hathawayj@byui.edu\")\nReplace hathawayj and hathawayj@byui.edu with your name and email address. Your name could be your GitHub username, or your actual first and last name. Your email address must be the email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n\nOption 2: use the shell\nOpen the shell on your computer. From there, type the following commands (replace the relevant parts with your own information):\n\ngit config --global user.name 'hathawayj'\n\nThis can be your full name, your username on GitHub, whatever you want. Each of your commits will be logged with this name, so make sure it is informative for others.\n\ngit config --global user.email 'hathawayj@byui.edu'\n\nThis must be the email address you used to register on GitHub.\n\n\nYou will not see any output from these commands.

    "section": "Using Git within RStudio",
    "text": "Using Git within RStudio\nRStudio can only act as a GUI front-end for Git if Git has been successfully installed AND RStudio can find it.\nA basic test for successful installation of git is to simply enter git in the shell. If you get a complaint about git not being found, it means installation was unsuccessful or that it is not being found, i.e. it is not on your PATH.\nIf you are not sure where the git executable lives, try this in a shell:\n\nwhich git (Mac, Linux)\nwhere git (most versions of Windows)\n\nIf Git appears to be installed and findable, launch RStudio and try again. If it still doesn’t work, quit and re-launch RStudio if there’s any doubt in your mind about whether you opened RStudio before or after installing Git.\nFrom RStudio, go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN and make sure that the box Git executable points to the Git executable. It should read something like:\n\n/usr/bin/git (Mac, Linux)\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe (Windows)\n\nIf you make any changes, restart RStudio and try the steps at the top of the page again.\nStill not working? Try googling your problem or speak with myself or the TA.\n\nTest Drive RStudio and GitHub\n\nStep 1: Create a GitHub repo\n\nGo to GitHub.com and login.\nClick the green “New Repository” button\n\nRepository name: myrepo\nPublic\nCheck Initialize this repository with a README\nClick the green “Create repository” button\n\nCopy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green “Clone or Download” button.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Clone GitHub repo with RStudio\nIn RStudio, start a new Project:\n\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. It will be something like https://github.com/hathawayj/myrepo.git.\n\nDo you NOT see an option to get the Project from Version Control? Make sure RStudio can find Git (see above).\n\nDecide where to store the local directory for the Project. Don’t scatter everything around your computer - have a central location, or some meaningful structure. For repositories you create in this course, you can setup a /cfss directory and clone all your repos there.\nI suggest you check “Open in new session”, as that’s what you’ll usually do in real life.\nClick “Create Project” to create a new sub-directory, which will be all of these things:\n\na directory on your computer\na Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository *an RStudio Project\n\nWhenever possible, this will be the preferred route for setting up your R projects.\n\nThis should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file.\nWhy setup your R projects this way? There’s a big advantage to the “Github first, then RStudio”” workflow: the remote GitHub repo is now the “upstream” remote for your local repo. In essence, you are already setup to push and pull commits to GitHub. There is no need to set anything else up through the shell or a Git client. If you would like to connect GitHub to a previously created R-Studio project you can follow this guide.\n\n\nStep 3: Change, save, commit\nDo this every time you finish a valuable chunk of work, probably many times a day.\n\nFrom RStudio, modify the README.md file by adding the line “This is a line from RStudio”. Save your changes.\nCommit these changes to your local repo. How?\nFrom RStudio:\n\nClick the “Git” tab in the upper right pane.\nCheck the “Staged” box for any files whose existence or modifications you want to commit.\nTo see more detail on what’s changed in file since the last commit, click on “Diff” for a Git pop-up.\nIf you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”\nType a message in “Commit message”. This should describe for a human what modifications you’ve made to the staged files.\nClick “Commit”.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Push commits to GitHub\nDo this a few times a day, but possibly less often than you commit.\nYou have new work in your local Git repository, but the changes are not online yet.\nBefore you push your changes to GitHub, first you should pull from GitHub. Why? If you make changes to the repo in the browser or from another machine or (one day) a collaborator has pushed, you will be happier if you pull those changes in before you attempt to push.\n\nClick the blue “Pull” button in the “Git” tab in RStudio. I doubt anything will happen, i.e. you’ll get the message “Already up-to-date”. This is just to establish a habit.\nNow click the green “Push” button to send your local changes to GitHub. You should see some message along these lines.\n[master dc671f0] blah\n 3 files changed, 22 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 .gitignore\n create mode 100644 myrepo.Rproj\n\nNow just rinse and repeat. Do work somewhere. Commit it. Push it or pull it depending on where you did it, but get local and remote “synced up”."

    "text": "R language background\nBeyond being FREE and the predominate statistical software used in science, industry, research, and business, it has great pedagogical advantages. Daniel Kaplan summarized a great learning/teaching advantage of using R in the following quote.\n\nIn mathematics and statistics, the output of one computation often becomes the input to another computation. That’s why math courses spend so much time talking about functions (and “domain” and “range”, etc.). In word processing, whenever you highlight a word and move it or change the font or replace it, you still end up with stuff on which you can perform the same operations: highlighting, moving, font-changing, etc. Not so in math and statistics. The sorts of operations that you will often perform - solving, integration, statistical summaries, etc. - produce a new kind of thing on which you will be performing new kinds of operations. In mathematics and statistics, you create a chain of operations and you need to be able to express the steps in that chain. It’s not a question of having enough buttons to list all the operations, you’ll need combinations of operations - more than could possibly be listed in a menu system.1\n\nFor those of you coming from a computer science background, John D. Cook provides some useful insight2\n\nI have written software professionally in perhaps a dozen programming languages, and the hardest language for me to learn has been R. The language is actually fairly simple, but it is unconventional.\n\nWe can also track the competition between R and Python here.\nFor those of you coming from a business or engineering background, you should know that the difficulty of coding in Excel has contributed to some serious blunders in globally impactful discussions [1,2,3] and has serious flaws in how data are even handled.\nBelow are some references from reputable online sources about the impact and usefulness of R.\n\nFast Company Article on R\n\n“R can do literally everything, and all new research is done in R. So especially for businesses that really want to out-compete their competitors on the basis of advanced analytics, they can get access to everything they need within R, things that might not come for five or 10 years through commercial software,” says Smith.\n\nNew York Times on R\n\n“The great beauty of R is that you can modify it to do all sorts of things,” said Hal Varian, chief economist at Google. “And you have a lot of prepackaged stuff that’s already available, so you’re standing on the shoulders of giants.”\n\nInfoWorld\n\nStill, Adams and Peng both see R as an accessible language. “I don’t come from a computer science background and never had aspirations of becoming a programmer. Knowledge of programming fundamentals certainly helps when adding R to your toolbox, but I wouldn’t say it’s required to get started,” Adams says.\n“I wouldn’t even say R is for programmers. It’s best suited for people that have data-oriented problems they’re trying to solve, regardless of their programming aptitude.”"

    "text": "Learning R\nWe will spend time during class all semester learning new syntax. During the first two weeks we will spend a little more time learning the basics of R and how to use it (often the most challenging). Daniel Kaplan’s book also has a nice introduction.\n\nR, R-Studio, .Rmd files, and .R scripts\nWe will need to install R, R-Studio, and get comfortable with .Rmd files and .R files.\nR\n\nThe R website is where we can go to find the latest version to download for your particular operation system.\nHere is a video for Mac users and Windows users. There is also a Linux version of R as well.\n\n.R Scripts\n\n.R script files are the typical file type for saving your R scripts. This is often the file I start with for any analysis. In fact, if you have experience with .Rmd files, you can write an .R script in such a way that it can be built into an html page like an .Rmd file. See here.\n\nR-Studio & Rmd Files\n\nR-Studio is a great software to facilitate the use of R (and many other things). We will use R-Studio heavily in this course! Please download R-Studio.\n.Rmd files are the passport to a full space of data presentation opportunities. Here is an overview of R Markdown and its use in R-Studio. Finally, here is a short tutorial to get yourself up and running with R Markdown.\n\n\n\nR Help Files\n\nRDocumentation\n\n\n\nR-Studio and Workflow\nThis section was lifted from work done by jennybc’s development of STAT545.\n\n\nBasics of working with R at the command line and RStudio goodies\nLaunch RStudio/R.\nNotice the default panes:\n\nConsole (entire left)\nEnvironment/History (tabbed in upper right)\nFiles/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)\n\nFYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: Customizing RStudio.\nGo into the Console, where we interact with the live R process.\nMake an assignment and then inspect the object you just created.\nx &lt;- 3 * 4\nx\n## [1] 12\nAll R statements where you create objects – “assignments” – have this form:\nobjectName &lt;- value\nand in my head I hear, e.g., “x gets 12”.\nYou will make lots of assignments and the operator &lt;- is a pain to type. Don’t be lazy and use =, although it would work, because it will just sow confusion later. Instead, utilize RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign).\nNotice that RStudio automagically surrounds &lt;- with spaces, which demonstrates a useful code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day. Give your eyes a break and use spaces.\nRStudio offers many handy keyboard shortcuts. Also, Alt+Shift+K brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card.\nObject names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. You will be wise to adopt a convention for demarcating words in names.\ni_use_snake_case\nother.people.use.periods\nevenOthersUseCamelCase\nMake another assignment\nthis_is_a_really_long_name &lt;- 2.5\nTo inspect this, try out RStudio’s completion facility: type the first few characters, press TAB, add characters until you disambiguate, then press return.\nMake another assignment\njenny_rocks &lt;- 2 ^ 3\nLet’s try to inspect:\njennyrocks\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'jennyrocks' not found\njeny_rocks\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'jeny_rocks' not found\nImplicit contract with the computer / scripting language: Computer will do tedious computation for you. In return, you will be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. Get better at typing.\nR has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are accessed like so\nfunctionName(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, and so on)\nLet’s try using seq() which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, demo more helpful features of RStudio.\nType se and hit TAB. A pop up shows you possible completions. Specify seq() by typing more to disambiguate or using the up/down arrows to select. Notice the floating tool-tip-type help that pops up, reminding you of a function’s arguments. If you want even more help, press F1 as directed to get the full documentation in the help tab of the lower right pane. Now open the parentheses and notice the automatic addition of the closing parenthesis and the placement of cursor in the middle. Type the arguments 1, 10 and hit return. RStudio also exits the parenthetical expression for you.

But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want a sequence from = 1 that goes to = 10. Since we didn’t specify step size, the default value of by in the function definition is used, which ends up being 1 in this case. For functions I call often, I might use this resolve by position for the first argument or maybe the first two. After that, I always use name = value.\nMake this assignment and notice similar help with quotation marks.\nyo &lt;- \"hello world\"\nIf you just make an assignment, you don’t get to see the value, so then you’re tempted to immediately inspect.\ny &lt;- seq(1, 10)\ny\n##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\nThis common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and “print to screen” to happen.\n(y &lt;- seq(1, 10))\n##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\nNot all functions have (or require) arguments:\ndate()\n## [1] \"Mon Apr 29 11:21:33 2024\"\nNow look at your workspace – in the upper right pane.

pane.\n\n\nWorkspace and working directory\nOne day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis later.\nOne day you will have multiple analyses going that use R and you want to keep them separate.\nOne day you will need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results and figures from R back out into the world.\nTo handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions:\n\nWhat about your analysis is “real”, i.e. you will save it as your lasting record of what happened?\nWhere does your analysis “live”?\n\n\nWorkspace, .RData\nAs a beginning R user, it’s OK to consider your workspace “real”. Very soon, I urge you to evolve to the next level, where you consider your saved R scripts as “real”. (In either case, of course the input data is very much real and requires preservation!) With the input data and the R code you used, you can reproduce everything. You can make your analysis fancier. You can get to the bottom of puzzling results and discover and fix bugs in your code. You can reuse the code to conduct similar analyses in new projects. You can remake a figure with different aspect ratio or save is as TIFF instead of PDF. You are ready to take questions. You are ready for the future.\nIf you regard your workspace as “real” (saving and reloading all the time), if you need to redo analysis … you’re going to either redo a lot of typing (making mistakes all the way) or will have to mine your R history for the commands you used. Rather than becoming an expert on managing the R history, a better use of your time and psychic energy is to keep your “good” R code in a script for future reuse.\nBecause it can be useful sometimes, note the commands you’ve recently run appear in the History pane.\nBut you don’t have to choose right now and the two strategies are not incompatible. Let’s demo the save / reload the workspace approach.\nUpon quitting R, you have to decide if you want to save your workspace, for potential restoration the next time you launch R. Depending on your set up, R or your IDE, eg RStudio, will probably prompt you to make this decision.\nQuit R/Rstudio, either from the menu, using a keyboard shortcut, or by typing q() in the Console. You’ll get a prompt like this:\n\nSave workspace image to ~/.Rdata?\n\nNote where the workspace image is to be saved and then click Save.\nUsing your favorite method, visit the directory where image was saved and verify there is a file named .RData. You will also see a file .Rhistory, holding the commands submitted in your recent session.\nRestart RStudio. In the Console you will see a line like this:\n[Workspace loaded from ~/.RData]\nindicating that your workspace has been restored. Look in the Workspace pane and you’ll see the same objects as before. In the History tab of the same pane, you should also see your command history. You’re back in business. This way of starting and stopping analytical work will not serve you well for long but it’s a start.\n\n\nWorking directory\nAny process running on your computer has a notion of its “working directory”. In R, this is where R will look, by default, for files you ask it to load. It also where, by default, any files you write to disk will go. Chances are your current working directory is the directory we inspected above, i.e. the one where RStudio wanted to save the workspace.\nYou can explicitly check your working directory with:\ngetwd()\nIt is also displayed at the top of the RStudio console.\nAs a beginning R user, it’s OK let your home directory or any other weird directory on your computer be R’s working directory. Very soon, I urge you to evolve to the next level, where you organize your analytical projects into directories and, when working on project A, set R’s working directory to the associated directory.\nAlthough I do not recommend it, in case you’re curious, you can set R’s working directory at the command line like so:\nsetwd(\"~/myCoolProject\")\nAlthough I do not recommend it, you can also use RStudio’s Files pane to navigate to a directory and then set it as working directory from the menu: Session –&gt; Set Working Directory –&gt; To Files Pane Location. (You’ll see even more options there). Or within the Files pane, choose More and Set As Working Directory.\nBut there’s a better way. A way that also puts you on the path to managing your R work like an expert.\n\n\n\nRStudio projects\nKeeping all the files associated with a project organized together – input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures – is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via its projects.\nUsing Projects\nLet’s make one to use for the rest of this workshop/class. Do this: File &gt; New Project …. The directory name you choose here will be the project name. Call it whatever you want (or follow me for convenience).\nI created a directory and, therefore RStudio project, called swc in my tmp directory, FYI.\n\nsetwd(\"~/tmp/swc\")\nNow check that the “home” directory for your project is the working directory of our current R process:\ngetwd()\nI can’t print my output here because this document itself does not reside in the RStudio Project we just created.\nLet’s enter a few commands in the Console, as if we are just beginning a project:\na &lt;- 2\nb &lt;- -3\nsig_sq &lt;- 0.5\nx &lt;- runif(40)\ny &lt;- a + b * x + rnorm(40, sd = sqrt(sig_sq))\n(avg_x &lt;- mean(x))\n## [1] 0.447281\nwrite(avg_x, \"avg_x.txt\")\nplot(x, y)\nabline(a, b, col = \"purple\")\n\ndev.print(pdf, \"toy_line_plot.pdf\")\n## quartz_off_screen \n##                 2\nLet’s say this is a good start of an analysis and your ready to start preserving the logic and code. Visit the History tab of the upper right pane. Select these commands. Click “To Source”. Now you have a new pane containing a nascent R script. Click on the floppy disk to save. Give it a name ending in .R or .r, I used toy-line.r and note that, by default, it will go in the directory associated with your project.\nQuit RStudio. Inspect the folder associated with your project if you wish. Maybe view the PDF in an external viewer.\nRestart RStudio. Notice that things, by default, restore to where we were earlier, e.g. objects in the workspace, the command history, which files are open for editing, where we are in the file system browser, the working directory for the R process, etc. These are all Good Things.\nChange some things about your code. Top priority would be to set a sample size n at the top, e.g. n &lt;- 40, and then replace all the hard-wired 40’s with n. Change some other minor-but-detectable stuff, i.e. alter the sample size n, the slope of the line b,the color of the line … whatever. Practice the different ways to re-run the code:\n\nWalk through line by line by keyboard shortcut (command + enter) or mouse (click Run in the upper right corner of editor pane).\nSource the entire document – equivalent to entering source('toy-line.r') in the Console – by keyboard shortcut (shift command S) or mouse (click Source in the upper right corner of editor pane or select from the mini-menu accessible from the associated down triangle).\nSource with echo from the Source mini-menu.\n\nVisit your figure in an external viewer to verify that the PDF is changing as you expect.\nIn your favorite OS-specific way, search your files for toy_line_plot.pdf and presumably you will find the PDF itself (no surprise) but also the script that created it (toy-line.r). This latter phenomenon is a huge win. One day you will want to remake a figure or just simply understand where it came from. If you rigorously save figures to file with R code and not ever ever ever the mouse or the clipboard, you will sing my praises one day. Trust me.\n\n\nstuff\nIt is traditional to save R scripts with a .R or .r suffix. Follow this convention unless you have some extraordinary reason not to.\nComments start with one or more # symbols. Use them. RStudio helps you (de)comment selected lines with Ctrl+Shift+C (windows and linux) or Command+Shift+C (mac).\nClean out the workspace, ie pretend like you’ve just revisited this project after a long absence. The broom icon or rm(list = ls()). Good idea to do this, restart R (available from the Session menu), re-run your analysis to truly check that the code you’re saving is complete and correct (or at least rule out obvious problems!).\nThis workflow will serve you well in the future:\n\nCreate an RStudio project for an analytical project\nKeep inputs there (we’ll soon talk about importing)\nKeep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole from there\nKeep outputs there (like the PDF written above)\n\nAvoid using the mouse for pieces of your analytical workflow, such as loading a dataset or saving a figure. Terribly important for reproducility and for making it possible to retrospectively determine how a numerical table or PDF was actually produced (searching on local disk on filename, among .R files, will lead to the relevant script).\nMany long-time users never save the workspace, never save .RData files (I’m one of them), never save or consult the history. Once/if you get to that point, there are options available in RStudio to disable the loading of .RData and permanently suppress the prompt on exit to save the workspace (go to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General).\nFor the record, when loading data into R and/or writing outputs to file, you can always specify the absolute path and thereby insulate yourself from the current working directory. This is rarely necessary when using RStudio Projects properly."
