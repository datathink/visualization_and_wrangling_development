## Case Study 4: Reducing Gun Deaths (FiveThirtyEight) 
### Background 

The world is a dangerous place.  During 2015 and 2016 there was a lot of discussion in the [news about police shootings](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/controversial-police-shootings/){target="blank"}.  [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/){target="blank"} reported on [gun deaths in 2016](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/){target="blank"}.  As leaders in data journalism, they have posted a clean version of this data in their GitHub repo called [full_data.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data){target="blank"} for us to use. 

While their visualizations focused on yearly averages, our client wants to create commercials that help reduce the gun deaths in the US.  They would like to target the commercials in different seasons of the year (think month variable) to audiences that could have the most impact in reducing gun deaths. Our challenge is to summarize and visualize seasonal trends accros the other variables in these data.
