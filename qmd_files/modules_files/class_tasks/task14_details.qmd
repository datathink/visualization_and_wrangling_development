## Task 14: Counting Words and Occurrences 
### Background 

In 1978 Susan Easton Black [penned an article](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/07/discovery?lang=eng){target="blank"} in the Ensign title *Even statistically, he is the dominant figure of the Book of Mormon.* which makes some statistical claims about the Book of Mormon. We are going to use some of our "string" skills to count words and occurrences in the New Testament and in the Book of Mormon.

1. What is the average verse length (number of words) in the New Testament compared to the Book of Mormon?
2. How often is the word Jesus in the New Testament compared to the Book of Mormon?
3. How does the word count distribution by verse look for each book in the Book of Mormon?
