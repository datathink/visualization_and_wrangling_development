## Task 18: The US Grocer (KR) 
### Background 

Interactive visualizations can often be powerful for data investigations.  They let your team get at questions in real time.  Use the Kroger (KR) stock price to build an interactive visualization of their performance over the last five years. Take some time to build a couple of different visualizations that show Krogers performance.  See the task items below for a description.
