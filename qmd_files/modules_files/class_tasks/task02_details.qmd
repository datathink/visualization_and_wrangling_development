## Task 2: Wax On, Wax off 
### Background 
This task is intended to get all of us on the same page in R.  You will copy code from your readings and then improve the Research and Creative Works conference visulization from [this Excel file](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/department_data.xlsx). Even if you have used R before, this will be an excellent refresher. If you do not get the title of this task, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMCsXl9SGgY).
