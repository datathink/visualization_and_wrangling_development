## Task 7: Data to Answer Questions 
### Background 

Finding good data takes time, and can take longer than the time to tidy your data.  This task could easily take 3-6 hours to find the data you need for your [semester project](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/project.html).  After you find good data sources make sure to complete the remaining tasks.
